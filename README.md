This repository is intended to create and publish my assignments required by Mckinsey. The set of questions that I have been given are:

1. Create an app that will be executed in terminal or from the command line. The app should accept a hashtag as an argument and should only print out unique urls found in the 100 most recent tweets that matched the hashtag.

2. Given an array of integers, write some code to find all the integers that appear more than once in the array, sorted by which appears most often to least often (once)

The programming language in use will most likely be Python.

Ciao.
